## 📦 What is RoboShop?

RoboShop is a modern **e-commerce application** built using a **microservices architecture**, where each service is developed using a different tech stack like Node.js, Java, Python, Go, etc.

This repository contains shell scripts to automate the installation, configuration, and management of all services and dependencies involved in RoboShop.
